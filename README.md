# Tea-disease-Classification
A ResNET 50 model for Tea disease classification

Up untill now the model is not completed ... the validation accuracy is not improving neither the test accuracy.... I will be trying something to improve the accuracy..

I have found a new dataset as the previous one was not enough . I will be training on this new dataset with 9 output neurons as the new dataset has an additional class of Reptolea disease. I will start training the model with the prelearned weights of the previous model. Tea disease classification(poor accuracy)
